** Abstract
   This talk highlights the issues that need to be addressed to successfully
   migrate from a GIS solution based on commercial products to a solution based
   on open-source software, in particular QGIS. What can be done? Where to
   start? What are the potential elements to convert? Which strategy to adopt?
   The talk will try to answer these questions by showing examples and lesson
   learned from successful Migrations. By presenting ad-hoc open source tools
   developed to solve specific problems and explaining how a migration can be
   tackled in cases where there are currently no specific tools we want to give
   you all the information needed to take informed decisions.
